-- 23 Managing SQL Plan Baselines --

SQL plan management :
A preventative mechanism that enables the optimizer to automatically manage execution plans, 
ensuring that the database uses only known or verified plans.

-- Differences Between SQL Plan Baselines and SQL Profiles --
-------------------------------------------------------------

Both SQL profiles and SQL plan baselines help improve the performance of SQL statements by ensuring that the optimizer uses only optimal plans.

Both profiles and baselines are internally implemented using hints. 
However, these mechanisms have significant differences, including the following:

In general :
* SQL plan baselines are PROACTIVE.
* SQL profiles are REACTIVE.

Typically, you create SQL plan baselines before significant performance problems occur. 
SQL Plan Baselines prevent the optimizer from using suboptimal plans in the future.

-- 
The database creates SQL profiles when you invoke SQL Tuning Advisor, which you do typically only after a SQL statement has shown high-load symptoms. 
SQL profiles are primarily useful by providing the ongoing resolution of optimizer mistakes that have led to suboptimal plans. 
Because the SQL profile mechanism is reactive, it cannot guarantee stable performance as drastic database changes occur.
