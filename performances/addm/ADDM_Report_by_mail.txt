Can ADDM report be mailed to user automatically.?

The ADDM report cannot be mailed automatically. 

The Grid Control reporting system is designed to run against the Grid Control repository, 

while the ADDM reports are stored in the AWR repository of each database target.

There is however a way to get the ADDM reports mailed to users. 

You could set up a SQL job in grid control, and have the output emailed to users.

Here is some sample SQL that could generate a report. 

It outputs the most recently created ADDM report for a given database. 

The code needs to run in the target database.  This sample code works for only 11g databases.
============================================
col tname new_value l_task_name
SET LONG 1000000 PAGESIZE 0;

select task_name tname
from dba_advisor_tasks
where created =
(select max(created)
from dba_advisor_tasks);

SELECT DBMS_ADDM.GET_REPORT('&l_task_name') FROM DUAL;
============================================

TNAME
