ADDM
----
 
In Oracle, ADDM stands for Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor. 
An ADM report details potential performance bottlenecks and recommendations on what actions can be perform to alleviate the problems. 

The report provides:
* Findings
* Recommendations
* Estimated Impact on Performance
 
The simplest way to generate this report is through the Oracle Enterprise Manager tool (OEM); however, there are times when this tool is not available. 

On those occasions, the DBA user can generate the report from the machine hosting Oracle, as described in the steps below.

To generate the ADDM report:
---------------------------

1/ Log in to the machine hosting Oracle.
In the command prompt issue the following 

	command: sqlplus system @$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/addmrpt.sql

When you are asked for a system password, type it in and press Enter.

2/ Specify a begin_snap from the list and press Enter.
3/ Specify the end_snap from the list and press Enter.
4/ Name the report and press Enter.
5/ Issue the quit command to exit from SQLPlus.

The report is generated at the path where the SQLPlus command was issued.
