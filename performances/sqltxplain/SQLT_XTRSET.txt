
XTRSET Method
--------------
The XTRSET extracts from memory or AWR a list of SQL statements identified by their SQL_ID or HASH_VALUE 
then it executes the XTRACT on each of the SQL statements. 

At the end it consolidates all the SQLT files into a single compressed file. 
This XTRSET is used when benchmarking the same set of SQL statements over a series of tests.

When this method is used, it asks once for the SQLTXPLAIN password, which is needed to export the SQLT repository 
for each execution of XTRACT on the list of SQL statements.

To use this XTRSET method, SQLT has to be installed first. Navigate to the sqlt/run directory 
and start SQL*Plus connecting as the application user that issued all or most of the SQL statements. 

From there, execute the sqlt/run/sqltxtrset.sql script. When asked, pass the comma-separated list of SQL statements identified by their SQL_ID 
or HASH_VALUE, and the password for SQLTXPLAIN
