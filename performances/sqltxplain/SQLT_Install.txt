SQLT Installation Overview
--------------------------



requires about 10MB of space for the installation.
 
Allocate 50-100MB of space for this schema to allow for data creation in the schema as the utility is used. 


Installation prompts:

1.Connect identifier for TNS connections (optional).

2.SQLTXPLAIN database user password.

3.Default and temp tablespaces for SQLTXPLAIN user.

4.Main application user of the SQLT utility. 
This user will be the one to execute the SQLT scripts. 
Note that additional users can be added to the configuration later.

5.Management Pack license, if any:
•"T" if you have license for Diagnostic and Tuning
•"D" if you have license only for Oracle Diagnostic
•"N" if you do not have these two licenses
•After the last prompt, the remainder of the installation should take just a few minutes to complete.
