-------------

•Takes as its input a text file containing a SQL statement or STS.


•Invoke SQL*Plus from the <SQLT_HOME>/run/ directory 
and connect as the database user that would normally execute a particular SQL statement or set of statements 

execute this command: 

cd <SQLT_HOME>/run/ 
SQL> start sqltxecute <full_pathname_of_sql_script>


•The sqltxecute.sql script executes the SQL statement or statements in the STS.

•Therefore, the length of time that the sqltxecute.sql script takes is bound by what those SQL statements take to execute.

•The product of executing the script is a zipfile produced in the <SQLT_HOME>/run/ directory. 

To use this file, unzip it in any directory and open the *main.html file.
