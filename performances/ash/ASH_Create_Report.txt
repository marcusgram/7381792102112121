ASH Report
---------
In Oracle, ASH stands for Active Session History. 
An ASH report details statistics from the in-memory performance monitoring tables. 
The report provides:
	Top User Events (frequent wait events)
	Details to the wait events
	Top Queries
	Top Sessions
	Top Blocking Sessions
	Top DB Objects 
		(Note: be wary of the QRTZ_LOCKS result. 
		This table is what Quartz, our third-party Java scheduler, uses as a locking  mechanism. 
		As a result, any contention is intentional and will not affect  performance).
	Activity Over Time
 
The simplest way to generate this report is through the Oracle Enterprise  Manager tool (OEM); 
however, there are times when this tool is not available. 

On those occasions, the DBA user can generate the report from the machine hosting Oracle, as described in the steps below.


To generate the ASH report:
----------------------------

1/ Log in to the machine hosting Oracle.
2/ At a command prompt issue the following command: sqlplus system @$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/ashrpt.sql
   When you are asked for the system password, type it in and press Enter.
3/ Specify a format for the report and press Enter.
4/ Specify the begin time for the report and press Enter (e.g., -1:30 is one hour and 30 minutes before from the present time).
5/ Specify the duration for the report and press Enter 
	(for example, a value of 30 indicates that the report should cover from the begin time to 30 minutes after that time; 
	leaving the duration empty specifies that the report should cover from the begin time to the current time).
6/ Name the report and press Enter.
7/ Issue the quit command to exit from SQLPlus.
8/ The report is generated at the path where the SQLPlus command was issued.



how to enter in time for an ASH report:
---------------------------------------

Specify the timeframe to generate the ASH report

Enter begin time for report:
--    Valid input formats:

--      To specify absolute begin time:

--        [MM/DD[/YY]] HH24:MI[:SS]
--        Examples: 02/23/03 14:30:15
--                  02/23 14:30:15
--                  14:30:15
--                  14:30

--      To specify relative begin time: (start with '-' sign)
--        -[HH24:]MI
--        Examples: -1:15  (SYSDATE - 1 Hr 15 Mins)
--                  -25    (SYSDATE - 25 Mins)
