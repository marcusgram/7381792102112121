
-- This script shows which tables and indexes are either missing statistics or have stale statistics, 
and the statistics are not locked (meaning that a DBA has not intentionally blocked the object from getting statistics).  
The script filters out schemas that are installed with the database to show only user schemas.

-- This script helps a DBA find objects that need to be analyzed in case they are not using the AUTO method for DBMS_STATS.
