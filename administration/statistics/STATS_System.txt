SYSTEM STATISTICS
#################

What is system statistics:
-------------------------
System statistics are statistics about CPU speed and IO performance, it enables the CBO to
effectively cost each operation in an execution plan. Introduced in Oracle 9i.

Why gathering system statistics:
------------------------------
Oracle highly recommends gathering system statistics during a representative workload,
ideally at peak workload time, in order to provide more accurate CPU/IO cost estimates to the optimizer.
You only have to gather system statistics once.

There are two types of system statistics (NOWORKLOAD statistics & WORKLOAD statistics):

NOWORKLOAD statistics:
--------------------------
This will simulates a workload -not the real one but a simulation- and will not collect full statistics, it's less accurate than "WORKLOAD

statistics" but if you can't capture the statistics during a typical workload you can use noworkload statistics.

To gather noworkload statistics:

SQL> execute dbms_stats.gather_system_stats();

WORKLOAD statistics:
----------------------
This will gather statistics during the current workload -which supposed to be representative of actual system I/O and CPU workload on the DB-.

To gather WORKLOAD statistics:

SQL> execute dbms_stats.gather_system_stats('start');

Once the workload window ends after 1,2,3.. hours or whatever, stop the system statistics gathering:

SQL> execute dbms_stats.gather_system_stats('stop');

You can use time interval (minutes) instead of issuing start/stop command manually:

SQL> execute dbms_stats.gather_system_stats('interval',60);

Check the system values collected:
-------------------------------
col pname format a20
col pval2 format a40
set linesize 500
select * from sys.aux_stats$;

col pname format a20
col pval2 format a40
set linesize 500

cpuspeedNW: Shows the noworkload CPU speed, in terms of the average number of CPU cycles per
                           second.
ioseektim:  The sum of seek time, latency time, and OS overhead time.
iotfrspeed: I/O transfer speed,tells the optimizer how fast the database can read data in a single read
                           request.
cpuspeed:   Stands for CPU speed during a workload statistics collection.
maxthr:        The maximum I/O throughput.
slavethr:   Average parallel slave I/O throughput.
sreadtim:   The Single Block Read Time statistic shows the average time for a random single block read.
mreadtim:   The average time (seconds) for a sequential multiblock read.
mbrc:       The average multiblock read count in blocks.

According to Oracle, collecting workload statistics doesn't impose an additional overhead on your system.

Delete system statistics:
-------------------------
SQL> execute dbms_stats.delete_system_stats();
