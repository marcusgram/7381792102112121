-- There are several values for the options parameter that we need to know about:

    gather – re-analyzes the whole schema.
     
    gather empty – Only analyze tables that have no existing statistics.
     
    gather stale – Only re-analyze tables with more than 10% modifications (inserts, updates, deletes).
     
    gather auto – This will re-analyze objects which currently have no statistics and objects with stale statistics.   
                  Using gather auto is like combining gather stale and gather empty.
