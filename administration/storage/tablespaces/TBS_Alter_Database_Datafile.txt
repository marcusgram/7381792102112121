Resizing a Smallfile Tablespace Using ALTER DATABASE

In the following examples, we attempt to resize the USERS tablespace, which contains one
datafile, starting out at 5MB. First, we make it 15MB, then realize it’s too big, and shrink it down
to 10MB. Then, we attempt to shrink it too much. Finally, we try to increase its size too much.


alter database datafile '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/rmanrep/users01.dbf' resize 15m;

alter database datafile '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/rmanrep/users01.dbf' resize 10m;

alter database datafile '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/rmanrep/users01.dbf' autoextend on next 20m maxsize 1g;
